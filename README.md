## About the Project

The **Useless Store** is a collection of five apps that serve no real purpose. Each app is designed to entertain by being deliberately unhelpful. Use them for fun, to procrastinate, or simply to marvel at their pointlessness. 

## Apps in the Useless Store

1. **Flash**  
  A flashlight app that lets you turn the light on… and off… for no particular reason.
2. **App counter**  
   An app that counts your apps, just in case you needed to know the exact number of distractions on your phone.

3. **Games**  
   An app that loads endlessly, entertaining you with random funny messages while you wait… for absolutely nothing.

4. **Orange**  
   An app that only generates an orange screen.

5. **Wifi Scanner**  
   An app that shows nearby Wi-Fi networks—without actually letting you connect to any of them.

## Installation

To install and run the Useless Store on your device:

1. Clone the repository:
